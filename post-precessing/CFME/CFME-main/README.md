# Object Tracking in Satellite Videos by Improved Correlation Filters With Motion Estimations

This repo contains the source code for our TGRS work Object Tracking in Satellite Videos by Improved Correlation Filters With Motion Estimations. This repo is based on the code https://github.com/uoip/KCFpy. 

## Prerequisites
1. Python3
2. Opencv
3. Numpy
4. Numba

## Run the demo
you need to modify some file path in the demo.py
